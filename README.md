# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
## AIM

To develop a code to find the shortest route from the source to the destination point using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

## THEORY
Explain the problem statement

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Identify a location in the google map:

### STEP 2:
Select a specific number of nodes with distance

### STEP -> Write your own steps:


## ROUTE MAP
#### Include your own map
#### Example map

## PROGRAM
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
import math
import sys
from collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter
from itertools import combinations
import heapq
class Problem(object):
    """The abstract class for a formal problem. A new domain subclasses this,
    overriding `actions` and `results`, and perhaps other methods.
    The default heuristic is 0 and the default action cost is 1 for all states.
    When yiou create an instance of a subclass, specify `initial`, and `goal` states 
    (or give an `is_goal` method) and perhaps other keyword args for the subclass."""

    def __init__(self, initial=None, goal=None, **kwds): 
        self.__dict__.update(initial=initial, goal=goal, **kwds) 
        
    def actions(self, state):        
        raise NotImplementedError
    def result(self, state, action): 
        raise NotImplementedError
    def is_goal(self, state):        
        return state == self.goal
    def action_cost(self, s, a, s1): 
        return 1
    
    def __str__(self):
        return '{0}({1}, {2})'.format(
            type(self).__name__, self.initial, self.goal)

## OUTPUT:

Justify that the algorithm always returns the shortest path:
